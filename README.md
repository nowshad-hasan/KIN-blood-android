### About
KIN is a voluntary organization of SUST (Shahjalal University of Science & Technology), Bangladesh. One of the major activities of this
organization is to manage blood instantly for general people. Normally university students donate blood in this fact. To comunicate
between donor and client, KIN has a fixed post called 'Blood Secretary' who manages blood and write the latest donation date of the donor.
The whole process of this system is managed in diary that means offline. So, to make the system automated I made this android app where the
secretary can do the whole things online.
